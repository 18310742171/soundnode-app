Soundnode App is a Open-Source project to support Soundcloud for desktop. <br>
Built with Node-Webkit, Node.js, Angular.js and consuming Soundcloud API.

**Why I built it?!** take a look here on my [blog post](http://www.bymichaellancaster.com/blog/soundnode-soundcloud-for-desktop-dev-release/)

## Features

- Free

## beta Developer release

Since the core is done I figured release a beta version just for devs/community to receive feedback/contributions.

## How to contribute

First, building, testing and reporting bug is highly appreciated. Please include console's output and reproduction step in your bug report.

## Development

Check out how to run Node-Webkit here [Node-Webkit page](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit/wiki/How-to-run-apps)

Node-Webkit don't support mp3 and h264 in video and audio tag by default because of patented media formats.
but here's how you can [support audio](https://github.com/Soundnode/soundnode-app/wiki/Support-mp3-and-h264-in-video-and-audio-tag) and develop.
